## In case you need to change some data

- The **data** in the sections is **dynamic**
- The data files are located in the **`'/settings'`** folder
- Each section has its' own file name accordingly **(`hero.ts` for Hero section)**

## Notes on how to change data correctly and not mess it up

- **NEVER** change the **data structure** or the **data type** of the item (e.g. **NEVER** convert `int` to `string`, `array` to `object`, etc.)
- I've written **`HTML`** as a **`string`** in some places, to respect the highlighted or colored parts of a paragraph. If you are confused, just remember that it is same **`HTML`**, but written in 1 line. [**LEARN HTML.**](https://www.w3schools.com/html/)
- The personal data can be found in the file **`/settings/personal.data.ts`**. This file includes your _phone number_ and your _email_ used in the website.
